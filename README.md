# -E-Library
a simple e-library code using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript:

This code creates a simple e-library where books are displayed as thumbnails. The books are styled using CSS and each book is linked to a JavaScript function that displays an alert message when it is clicked. This code can be extended to include additional functionality, such as opening a detailed view of the book or allowing users to check out books.
